# UniK Changelog

## Tue Nov 15 2016
* Mirage volumes support is back. thanks to @yomimono.

## Tue Nov 10 2016
* Added support for new docker for mac (removed device-mapper dependency for building images)
* Temporary dropped supprot for mirage volumes (pending https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fat/issues/54)

## Tue Nov 8 2016
* Added support for ruinning Go+Rumprun on Google Cloud

## Fri Sep 23 2016
* Thanks to contributions from the folks at [Project Mikelangelo](https://www.mikelangelo-project.eu/), Openstack is now supported as a UniK provider. Currently we're configured to support Openstack installations which are running on top of QEMU as their hypervisor. Other hypervisor support is possible, but not a priority at this time. Openstack+QEMU supports all of UniK's currently supported unikernels (except for Mirage, which currently runs exclusively on Xen).

## Fri Aug 26 2016
* Changed CLI / REST API for building images. `--compiler` flag was removed in favor of `--base` and `--language` flags, which combine with the existing `--provider` flag to look up the relevant compiler. The cli still exposes the `unik compilers` command in order to list all available combinations.

## Thu Aug 25 2016
* Added support for Java running on Rumprun. I will buy a 10$ Steam gift card for anyone who can get Minecraft (or Glowstone) running on it. See the [updated rump documentation](compilers/rump.md#java)
* Added optional Runtime Args to Rump compilers based on Nodejs, Python, and Java; these are for arguments passed to the interpreter/runtime for a language before the application is run; i.e. inserting the `-Dsome.property=value` running `java -Dsome.property=value -jar myapp.jar` is now supported

## Mon Aug 22 2016
* Configure http://hub.project-unik.io as a public repository for uploadable UniK unikernels. Providers that use local storage (Xen, Virtualbox, QEMU) now support `unik pull` & `unik push` as command-line options allowing users to store and share unikernel images in public (or private) repositories. Source for deploying a private hub can be found here: https://github.com/ilackarms/unik-hub

## Tue Aug 16 2016
* Add support for local Xen provider. Supports Rump and OSv unikernels at current time. Persistent (data) volumes are still a TODO on Xen.
* Add support for VMware Photon API as an additional means of running unikernels on ESXi. Support is still a work-in-progress and not well-documented at this time.

## Tue Aug 2 2016
* Update version of Rump in all Rump containers. Fixes I/O panic running Gorump on AWS

## Thu, Jul 28 2016
* UniK now supports running [IncludeOS](http://www.includeos.org/) Unikernels (for C++). Currently only the Virtualbox and QEMU providers can run IncludeOS unikernels.

## Fri, Jun 17 2016
* UniK's Containers are now (automatically) versioned by the first 16 characters of their SHA256 checksum.
* Changed OSv / Java support:
  * The OSv/Java compiler in UniK will now build a unikernel from any `.jar` or `.war` file.
  * There are two options for building Java unikernels:
    - directly from a compiled fat `.jar` or `.war` file
    - using UniK to invoke the build on your Java sources (e.g. with `mvn package` or `gradle build`)
  * UniK now requires that a `manifest.yaml` file be present in the root directory of Java projects. See the [OSv Java Compiler Documentation](compilers/osv.md#java) or the [Getting Started with Java (New)](getting_started_java.md) for more information.

### Tue, Jun 14 2016
* Added QEMU as a provider.
  * Note that the QEMU provider does not provide bridged networking support. This means that QEMU instances will not be reachable from the host network.
  * The QEMU provider includes support for debugging unikernels with `gdb`. See [the qemu provider docs](./providers/qemu.md) for more information.

### Tue, Jun 7 2016
*This update features a merge of* `develop` *into* `master`*, which includes a large number of changes, all pushed as a single bundle of features and fixes. Future merges will be more granular.*

**Major Changes:**
* Added support for building Python unikernels on rumprun using Python 3.5
* Boot Volumes are now mountable on rumprun unikernels
  * This enables UniK unikernels to serve static files (HTML, .js, etc.), as well as make scripting language-based unikernels (Javascript, Python) less memory-consumptive (as files no longer have to be loaded into memory at boot time).
  * Example fileservers available in `docs/examples`
* Testing:
  * An integration test suite based on [`ginkgo`](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) has been added to UniK.
  * Tests are located in the `pkg/client` package, with helper functions and scripts in `test`.
  * To run tests, install `go`, `ginkgo` and `gomega`, and run
    ```
    bash test/scripts/test_ginkgo.sh
    ```
    tests currently run against Virtualbox, and Virtualbox is therefore also required to run tests. Note that the tests assume `host_only` networking using `vboxnet1`. To change the VBox network used for tests, modify the values in [`test/scripts/test_ginkgo.sh`](../test/scripts/test_ginkgo.sh)
* Container versioning:
    * UniK's dockerized dependencies (all `projectunik` containers) now use version tags.
    * The purpose of this is to keep older versions of UniK stable while permitting containers hosted on Docker Hub to be updated.
    * To upgrade containers, you only need to run
    ```
    git checkout master
    git pull
    make
    ```
    which will pull the latest versioned containers and recompile unik to utilize that version.

**Minor Changes:**
* Increased timeout when waiting for instance listener UDP packet
* Properly clean up build artifacts from `unik build`, `unik run`, `unik create-volume`
* Fix formatting of CLI output
* Do not auto-delete instances that do not reply to UDP broadcast before a specified timeout
